TS Mortar
==============

Utility functions for common TypeScript array, object, function, number, string, and enum operations. 
Similar to underscore or lodash, these functions are the product of needs I've encountered in Javascript/TypeScript over the last few years. 
See the /test directory for example usage of the functions in this project.
